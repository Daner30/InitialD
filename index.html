<!----- How to Drift! ------>

<section class="howtodrift">
	<h1>How to Drift!</h1>
	<p>Learn the step by step method on how to drift your car.</p>
	<p>“Technique can't be learned like tying your shoes or changing a flat tire. It's something you gotta figure out for yourself.”<br>- Bunta Fujiwara</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="howtodrift-col">
			<h3>A. Turning in</h3>
			<p>When learning to drift, our advice is to approach a tight 30mph turn in second gear at about 3000rpm – this will give you a decent amount of torque to keep the rear wheels spinning once you’ve induced oversteer. Remember drifting is not the fastest way round a corner so you’re not trying to set speed records here. Turn in and aim to apex about half way round at the geometric apex (the green line in Diagram 1 above).</p> <p>If apex too soon you can find that the car will run wide and you’ll have to compensate by ending the drift early, too late and you’ll be on the straight early and won’t have any time to sustain the drift. With practice you’ll be able to drift round the corner in a smooth arc which follows the racing line. Once you have mastered drifting along the racing line, you’ll then be able to start the drift earlier and sustain it for the entire corner, and even adjust the angle or steering simply by adjusting the throttle.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="howtodrift-col">
			<h3>B. Inducing the drift</h3>
			<p>At the apex of the corner you need to initiate oversteer, which sometimes is more difficult than it sounds. Drifting has developed its own unique terminology for techniques to ‘get the back out’ which are explained below. Remember that if you have a modern car with clever electronic stability control systems you’ll need to turn these off first.?</p>
			<p>If you have a powerful car it should be possible to break traction simply by accelerating sharply mid bend – this is the preferred method of inducing oversteer as it is easy to control and repeat. If you increase the throttle too slowly it’s unlikely anything other than understeer will occur, too hard and the car may spin. You’re aiming for a sharp, sustained hit of power in the right gear – practice will help you get the balance right. You might be surprised about how much power is required on a road with a good surface, so it might be helpful to chose a road which is either damp or has lower traction tarmac.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="howtodrift-col">
			<h3>C. Controlling and sustaining</h3>
			<p>Once the back starts to come round you need to act quickly. Keep the power on (you might be surprised how much power is required to sustain the drift), quickly counter-steer in the desired direction of travel, and balance the throttle to alter the attitude of the car. If the car is rotating too far ease off the gas then reapply as necessary.</p>
			<p>To sustain the drift you need to keep the power on to keep the rear wheels spinning – about 80% throttle is the rule of thumb (although you’ll need less in slippery or low traction conditions). If the back comes round too far, gently ease off the throttle and apply additional steering lock to correct the slide. If you’re finding it hard to keep the slide going, you may need to use more power or take the corner slightly faster.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="howtodrift-col">
			<h3>D. Ending the drift</h3>
			<p>Finishing the drift and getting the car straight again can be tricky – if you end the drift too quickly you might find the car starts to oversteer in the opposite direction, leading to ‘fishtailing’ and a pendulum effect which can be hard to control. The trick is to ease off the power smoothly and turn the steering rapidly and decisively back to the straight ahead position. Don’t let the steering run through your hands as this won’t give you the control you need.</p>

				<p>I love how they teach things. I improved so much that it only takes a week to learn drift racing. I feel like a professional drift racer already. I will soon achieve the drift king title thanks to the teachings here. Love the team and those who made this. You guys helps a lot.</p>
